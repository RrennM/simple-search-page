# Contributing to this repo
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
  * Reporting a bug
  * Discussing the current state of the code
  * Submitting a fix
  * Proposing new features
## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## To suggest a change/bug and to work on it follow the given steps:
  * Create an issue and describe it properly 
  (or work on an already created issue)
  * Wait for the maintainers to assign it to you 
  (This will make sure that someone else is not already working on it and will save everyone's time)
  * After you've been assigned you can work on it and then create a Pull request to get your changes merged
  * DO NOT create a pull request unless you have been assigned an issue else it will be marked invalid
  * Provide the output screenshot (if possible) in the comment while creating a pull request
